Over the summer of 2016 I volunteered to assist in the GenCyber event in Hawaii. We were called upon to create a Star Wars themed project that emphasised an element of cybersecurity outlined by the NSA. 
With this direction, I came up with the idea of a logic puzzle that has been encrypted. Following instructions to come to a logical conclusion based on deduction is a great problem solving tool.
The encryption, being an important part of data security had to be one in which high school aged participants will be able to work on.
I therefore decided on a basic Ceasar Cypher for the encryption, and designed a logic puzzle based on the star wars theme.

Wanting to make the puzzle itself engaging, I committed myself to designing a page that would uphold the theme and spark interest in encryption and logic.

The result of the project was really exciting, for it proved to be stimulating and difficult for the students, but one that could be solved with the right amount of application.
