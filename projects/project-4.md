## Project Overview
This project involved the engineering of a webpage that will bring the University of Hawaii community together to the activities of tabletop gaming. The project provided user security by only allowing those with a UH account access to the user pages. These pages included the browsing and selecting of scheduled games, the coordination of games, and the management of games.

## Personal Contributions
The many tasks required to complete the program was spread among the group. I personally contributed to this project with the creation of the initial design template, the calendar page, and the information page; which provides complete game information from a game selected in the browse page. I also modified the database, and connected my pages to the database. To ensure quality control I created mocha tests, corrected Eslint errors, and recruited beta-testers.

## Experience gained
The completion of this project has taught me many things in the field of software engineering. I learned a lot by working in a group to take active part in all the designing, developing and testing of this project. Group coordination, time management, and communication were all used in this environment.  This project also gave me skills with the types of programs used. GitHub and Git were used for our code sharing and time management platforms. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were all used on IntelliJ. Quality control was done with Eslint and the creation of Mocha and Chai tests. Meteor was the platform used to build the program, and the completed project was deployed via Galaxy.
