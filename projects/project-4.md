## Project Overview
This project involved the engineering of a webpage that will bring the University of Hawaii community together to the activities of tabletop gaming. The project provided user security by only allowing those with a UH account access to the user pages. 

These pages included the browsing and selecting of scheduled games, the coordination of games, and the management of games.


### Landing Page
Only public access to page. Has Login.

### Home Page
Welcomes users and provides instructions

### Browse Page
View scheduled games by category. Choose to join game or view more information.

### Information Page
Displays additional information about the game. Allows user to join game.

### Calendar Page
Displays all scheduled games on the calendar

### Manage Page
Allows user to manage games signed up to play, view games coordinating, and link to coordinate a new game

### New Game Page
A form in which the user gives out information pertaining to the game being scheduled


## Personal Contributions
The many tasks required to complete the program was spread among the group. I personally contributed to this project with the creation of the initial design template, the calendar page, and the information page; which provides complete game information from a game selected in the browse page.

I also modified the database, and connected my pages to the database. To ensure quality control I created mocha tests, corrected Eslint errors, and recruited beta-testers.

## Experience gained
The completion of this project has taught me many things in the field of software engineering. I learned a lot by working in a group to take active part in all the designing, developing and testing of this project. 

Group coordination, time management, and communication were all used in this environment.  This project also gave me skills with the types of programs used. GitHub and Git were used for our code sharing and time management platforms. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were all used on IntelliJ. Quality control was done with Eslint and the creation of Mocha and Chai tests. Meteor was the platform used to build the program, and the completed project was deployed via Galaxy.
