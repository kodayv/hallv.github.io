The Campus Travel Website is a web application that I created in my web programming class in ICS 415. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site and phone application.

The implementation of the website was through different application processes, to include WordPress, Html/php, and Ionic. The site features the ablity to create new Agents, book travels to various destinations and costs, search through the database, and a mobile friendly page.
