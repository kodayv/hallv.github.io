The Campus Travel Website is a web application that I created in my web programming class in ICS 415. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site and phone application.

The implementation of the website was through different application processes, to include WordPress, Html/php, and Ionic. The site features the ablity to create new Agents, book travels to various destinations and costs, search through the database, and a mobile friendly page.

To demonstrate the different types of coding mastery, the website gives the viewer access to four different versions of the Campus Travel website. One, with the use of Wordpress and html. Second, with the use of php and also html. Third, a hybrid between Wordpress and php. Last, the mobile friendly adaptation of the website. All the databases used were stored through CPanel, and the viewer had the ability to search, add, modify, and remove the data.

The project taught me a lot about web programming, and the various ways that the same outcome can be obtained. I really enjoyed the coding of a program that resulted in a visual outcome, for me seeing the program operate correctly gave me great satisfaction.
