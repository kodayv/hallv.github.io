This project is a report on the exploitation of the four servers on a lab network, 
which I have been instructed to penetrate during the University of Hawaii at Manoa Penetration Testing Event.
This document identifies the vulnerabilities that have been 
discovered during this period of assessment, how the vulnerabilities had been discovered,and the
recommended steps needed to secure the systems.
