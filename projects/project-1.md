The BB-8 Game was developed to show mastery over the Java language. The game has the player control the Star Wars robot bb-8 as it dodges shooting lazers in its mission to reach Rey.

For this project, I lead the team in the planning of this project. I took charge of the algorithm for the shooting of the lazers. The lazers were made by the use of recursion, while tracking their locations. I also created the health display of BB-8, as well as the animation of the introduction page and end. For the graphics, timing and loops were used to create the visual display.

The most important skill I got from this project occured during compilation. I compiled the main folder, and had to read and format the code from the other team members into the final project.

Here you can watch a recorded [video of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-63qS-Nhg4&feature=youtu.be).
