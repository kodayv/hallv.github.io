Software Engineering is a rigorous course offered at the University of Hawaii’s Computer Science program. The multitude of skills that can be obtained by taking this course makes it vital for anyone wanting to gain proficiency in the areas of programming. Below are a skills that are of personal interest to me..jpg

## Software Engineering Concepts
Becoming skilled at creating a program takes lots of practice. This course promises to develop proficiency in the design, implementation, and testing of a code. Project management, quality assurance, and the different coding environments are also important skills I am looking forward to having developed.

## Athletic Software Engineering
Being able to plan and implement swiftly and accurately under pressure is a very important skill in life, regardless of field of study. This course drills its students on coding quickly and accurately under pressure with timed exercises. It is my goal that this will sharpen my wit, as well as my coding ability.

## Professional Development
This course is the very reason as to why my GitHub portfolio is set up to begin with. It has already expanded myself out beyond LinkedIn, and will allow me the opportunity to place my professional image more into the eye of the public. This is an extremely important part of any student’s education, as it teaches students to maintain an updated resume, publish educational accomplishments, and to analyze what activities they do outside of class that can contribute to their professional goals. It is my goal that I will learn how to use GitHub to further expand my knowledge in the field of Computer Science, and be able to successfully demonstrate that knowledge.
