## Quality of code for learning

<img class="ui medium right floated image" src="../images/questions.jpg">
Being able to comprehend coding grammar makes it easier to learn other programing languages. For instance, the indentation of items in a scope is pretty universal regardless of programming language. A student of a new coding language can read a code, and understand that an area is in a scope, and with that better be able to learn the code with its basic grammar structure understanding.  While writing code is the best way to learn code, knowing the grammar of code is like knowing the grammar of a spoken language; once the structure is known, the learner can easily to grasp what a code is doing even if there is little knowledge of the vocabulary.

 ##  To understand, easier it is when proper grammar is used.

Let’s create a hypothetical scenario in which software engineer John has to create a program for a company. The code passes QC and becomes part of a company project. John eventually moves and gets a job elsewhere, and Peter is hired to take his place. A few years later the project that John created needs to be altered. Peter opens up the code and cries, because he cannot read John’s ‘bad grammar’. There is no indentation, spacing is bad, and before Peter can even start his part of the job, he must spend time to read John’s code. While Peter is now cursing all that is John, John himself is having problems in his new job. John’s new job requires him to collaborate in a group, and he cannot figure out where the bug is in his program. As his grammar in coding is nonexistent, his co-workers cannot read his code and help him either. Just like how proper grammar in writing an essay makes it easy to read, understand, and find errors, the proper grammar in writing code returns the same values. 

## Grammar with ESLint

Does this mean that every code written will have to be scrutinized by hand before publication? No! As the wonderful world of coding tries to make lives easier for coders, there are applications that do the grammar checking for you. Once example is ESLint for the IntelliJ platform. ESLint will reward good grammar with a green checkmark, and like Spellcheck, but an angry red squiggle under items that need to be fixed. The ability to make a code not only work well, but look well, also makes a person able to write better code, as the checker ‘trains’ coders the proper format.

While there are  many ways to improve the quality of a code; number of lines, amount of memory required, processing speed, I believe that coding standards is an overlooked but important software technique that should be applied to all levels of coding.
