## POWER

There are many different modern definitions of power found today.  What this means is that when someone has power over other people they can affect people indirectly, make them take an idea, or force them to take an action. Power does not mean that an action is being taken, but merely that the potential or ability to do these things are present. The root of power can be seen in organizations and governments, and a function of culture. In Machiavelli’s ‘The Prince’, the source of power is the prince over his kingdom (2006). This monarchy puts one person in power over many, and the advice that Machiavelli gives remarks on the type of power they had. They had the ability to take life, property, and women, pass laws and collect taxes, and be loved or feared (Machiavelli 2006). These abilities that the ruler had coincides with the contemporary definitions of power. The Prince has the ability to affect people indirectly by executing a robber, therefore discouraging others from committing robbery. He can implement an idea into others by having people love or fear him through his actions. He can also force people into action by creating jobs by having roads built or a militia assembled.

## Timeless Advice

The advice that Machiavelli gives to the ruler can also be valid to this day. Chapter 15 talks of things that a ruler will be blamed for. He advises the ruler to not neglect projects that are already in motion in favor of new projects, lest ruin fall upon them (Machiavelli 2006). Likewise, a politician should never abandon a running program in order to focus on a new project. The public will see all, and blame the politician for the neglect of the things that were working. Machiavelli also warns leaders about keeping virtuous, and how it would lead to their downfall (2006). As “how one lives is so far distant than how one ought to live” no one is ever perfect (Machiavelli, 2006, ch15).

## Political Ethics

A competitive politician can always find something to publically announce in attempt to discredit their opponents, and a virtuous politician will be completely discredited and left unelected as the opponents will look like shining stars. A politician must be able to find ways to make themselves look better than their competition, even if it means making the others look bad. They must “know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity” (Machiavelli 2006).Chapter 17 speaks of the ruler being loved over being feared, and which one would be better. The ability to keep everyone loyal and united is more important that having everyone happy at you. To keep the country united, the rest of the world must be seen as less good. Schools, sports stadiums, and parades all share the pride of the nation to increase the loyalty of the people. When a ruler is loved, it is because the person chooses to love them, while the actions that a ruler does can instill fear into the people (Machiavelli 2006). While local politicians are to attempt to make the voters love them, the laws that are in place can instill fear into anyone who is deviant. If a person breaks a law, propaganda shows that they will get caught and their life will be miserable. If a person looks or behaves deviantly and has children, their children may get taken away by the state. If a person grows and cans their own food, collects rainwater, and makes their own soap they can be arrested under suspicion as a terrorist and lose all their rights as a citizen. These rules instill fear into people to ensure that they behave a certain way, as “men love according to their own will, and fear according to that of the prince”, or government (Machiavelli, 2006, ch17).

## Conclusion

Although there are many definitions of power, the concept is still the same no matter what era is being referenced. The notions of power that The Prince has still applies to the modern definitions, showing that power is the same through the ages. The advice that Machiavelli gives to the reader is also valid information that can be used by today’s politicians and government.
