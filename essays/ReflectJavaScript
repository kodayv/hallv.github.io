## JavaScript
Having experience in C, C+, html, php and Java, my JavaScript based class has me classified as a newbie once again. Against the other programs that I already know, JavaScript seems to be more intuitive than C, cleaner than html, and moderately easier to read than Java. However, having just begun my JavaScript programming I am certain more differences will come up. From a software engineering perspective learning, the ease of the environment in which JavaScript can be run allows for a quicker implementation and testing, faster troubleshooting, and easier project management which makes this language good for learning students.
## Ready, set, code!
Athletic software engineering is where the students are given a coding problem, and then are pressed for completing a working code within a certain amount of time. These ‘workout of the days’, or ‘WODs’ are great mental exercises. Not only is one’s JavaScript coding pushed onto the student for mastery, but the mind is pushed to think quickly and create a solution. Is it stressful? Yes! It should be, for everyone needs to learn to be functional under pressure. Is it enjoyable? Like any competition the enjoyment comes from finishing on top. Not being able to complete the code on time due to a simple syntax error can be extremely frustrating, but that is also another important element of life that everyone needs to learn how to handle. It also makes the successful coding WODs all the more rewarding. These exercises are very useful for everyone for all of these skills. I know that I will get better at coding through this!
