My introduction to Meteor was a lot like going to see a meteor shower: someone pitches the idea to you that there is this ‘thing’; shiny and awesome that everyone should do. Hesitantly you accept this idea ‘ok let’s give it a try’. Download…like the trip out from the city to see the meteor shower; long and dark, where you stare at the screen asking yourself ‘are we there yet?’

Once it is downloaded you got to get a comfortable spot where you can stare at your code, hoping to get some of that shiny wonderment you have been told about. However, there is only darkness above you. Once your eyes start to make out the luminescent dots in the screen, you now ask yourself ‘what am I looking at?’ Oh, those are stars, but where is the meteor? How about some typing over there? Nope, only darkness.


 As the complexity of the code drives many errors, the darkness on the screen starts filling up your soul. ‘Why am I doing this? Of all the other things I could be spending my time doing, I am starting at this dark screen in the middle of the night waiting for a tiny streak of light.’ Hopelessness starts creeping; and the thoughts of calling it quits 2 hours ago is now screaming at you. Then, something happens. A tiny streak of light. Was it imagined? Had my mind lost itself and has created phantoms now to taunt my tainted soul? Another one!

The dark hollow within you starts filling up with these tiny sparks of success. Maybe I should record the meteor shower, to show others? No amount of video recordings can give the appropriate amount of awe given to those who went out to use the code. So the next day when you tell your friends about your awesome experience, you simply say ‘you got to just try it out yourself’.

The real question is, how objectively awesome is meteor? Psychologically speaking, the harder something is to achieve, the more personal satisfaction is gained when that thing is obtained. Also, the mind is quick to dismiss events that are tedious and unpleasant so the memory of an event that is objectively horrible but had one good part in it will eventually be remembered on the emotions and event surrounding that good part.

Meteor is a complex program that is merciless to beginners. What makes it difficult is the requirement of the coder to understand a multitude of programming tools and their interactions. However, it is also the synergies of these different tools which make Meteor very interesting. Once the synergies are worked out, the shining project can be seen.
