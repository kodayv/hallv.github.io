##  The problem
There are many events happening at UH Manoa. There are signs out all over the place, and webpages that show club meetings, registration deadlines, and scholarship due dates. The problem is that the way the information is disseminated does not allow a satisfactory amount of students to be well informed. Busy students and do not notice the signs and billboard posts, or do not walk in the areas in which they are posted. Emails and online postings may get overlooked or forgotten as homework piles up. Websites that have dates of events are not all known to the entire student body, as there is no one location for all these events in which a student can go to.

## The Solution
The creation of a web application that will apply student selected subscriptions to their UH Gmail Calendar will allow students to select what interests they wish to follow as well as give them reminders of upcoming deadlines.

## Mockup Page Ideas
•	Public Landing page
•	Login page
•	User home page
•	Admin home page
•	User Subscriptions
•	Browse UH evens by category 

## Use Case Ideas 
•	New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, browses subscriptions, subscribes to selected events
•	Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
•	User goes to landing page, logs in, adds subscriptions, edits subscriptions

## Beyond the Basics
•	Syncs up with Google Calendar
•	Laulima also syncs up to the program, so that assignment due dates are added to calender
