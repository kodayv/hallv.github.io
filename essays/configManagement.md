## The Need of Configuration Management
<img class="ui medium right floated image" src="../images/group.jpg">

Having done group projects in the past, configuration management is extremely important for a group project to efficiently be programmed.   For my first group project, I have run into an issue that could have been negated with proper configuration management. Not knowing of the various software available for configuration management, everything was stored in a shared folder in the cloud. As the program progressed, the team-members simply saved over the latest version of the file. This became an issue when the program crashed. We ended up having to revert to an old version that was saved on one of the team-member's computer and rebuilding it from there. Had we known about configuration management before starting the project, we would have been able to track all the changes, and not be lost in despair when the program crashed.

## Git and GitHub

Of the various programs for configuration management, Git appears to be used the most. The same goes for GitHub as the most used cloud for programmers. The popularity of these two programs is due to the fact they both work together. Git in of itself is a really good configuration management program as various platforms can be used for programming, and the file can be uploaded and pushed onto GitHub. The history of every change is recorded, so that any mistakes can be tracked. This is very useful for those working on large projects and in a group. GitHub allows programs to be publicly shared, the various changes and forks to be monitored, and also allows programming to be directly done on the cloud. While both programs are really useful independently, the ability for both to be used easily is what draws in groups and individuals to use Git and GitHub for their programming.
