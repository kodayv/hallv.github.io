## Ethics in software engineering

As electronic technology encompasses more of human life, the issue of ethics in regards to this ever expanding industry must be addressed.
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) adopted their own <"http://www.acm.org/about/se-code">code of ethics</a> to which they believe all members should adhere to. Aside from professional conduct within a work environment, they believe that all programmers should contribute only positively to society while upholding human rights. In the application of software engineering for the public, this means providing trustworthy code that will protect personal identity, deliver a safe, quality product, and promote increased well-being in society.

## The driverless car

Self-driving vehicles have created an ethical controversy in their programming by addressing the threat of death that all vehicles carry. The current capabilities that the Tesla has enables the use of sonar to sense when an accident is about to occur, and take remedial action to protect the driver. 
A video compilation shows these accidents being identified at the same rate an attentive driver should be able to see. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ-d9k6JFA8"> Watch video</a>

## The hard decision

With this and other situations, what should a programmer do? No one wants to be on the dead end of the choice, and yet a choice must be made. If this was my decision, upholding the code, with the protection of the most people a priority would be how I would program the vehicle. The car will crash itself, and the jet-like injection seat will activate; shooting the driver out of the vehicle so that the driver’s life may also be spared. Seriously, thinking outside of the box is necessary in these decisions. Although ejection seats from a car does not work, if there is a way to use advancements in technology to also save the lives of those in the vehicle in case it has to self-destruct, then that too should be implemented. However, until such a time in which vehicles can be completely safe, the greatest good mentality should still apply, and the vehicle’s self-destruct feature, the ‘Hero Code’ be an understood risk of driving any vehicle. While people will be repulsed by this idea, the amount of times in which this feature will be used should be extremely small, and the use of driverless vehicles will still continue to increase.
